\arguments{
\item{crispr.runs}{A list of CrisprRun objects, typically representing individual samples
within an experiment}

\item{reference}{The reference sequence, must be the same length as the target region}

\item{target}{The target location (GRanges).  Variants will be counted over this region.
Need not correspond to the guide sequence.}

\item{rc}{Should the alignments be reverse complemented,
i.e. displayed w.r.t the reverse strand? (default: FALSE)}

\item{short.cigars}{If TRUE, variants labels are created from the location of their
insertions and deletions.  For variants with no insertions or deletions, the locations
of any single base mismatches are displayed (default: TRUE).}

\item{names}{A list of names for each of the samples, e.g. for displaying in plots.
If not supplied, the names of the crispr.runs are used, which default to the filenames
of the bam files if available (Default: NULL)}

\item{renumbered}{Should the variants be renumbered using target.loc as the zero point?
If TRUE, variants are described by the location of their 5'-most base with respect to the
target.loc.  A 3bp deletion starting 5bp 5' of the cut site would be labelled
(using short.cigars) as -5:3D (Default: TRUE)}

\item{target.loc}{The location of the Cas9 cut site with respect to the supplied target.
(Or some other central location).  Can be displayed on plots and used as the zero point
for renumbering variants. For a target region with the PAM location from bases 21-23,
the target.loc is base 18 (default: NA)}

\item{match.label}{Label for sequences with no variants (default: "no variant")}

\item{mismatch.label}{Label for sequences with only single nucleotide variants
(default: "SNV")}

\item{split.snv}{Should single nucleotide variants (SNVs) be shown for
reads without an insertion or deletion? (default: TRUE)}

\item{upstream.snv}{If split.snv = TRUE, how many bases upstream of the target.loc
should SNVs be shown?  (default: 8)}

\item{downstream.snv}{If split.snv = TRUE, how many bases downstream of the target.loc
should SNVs be shown? (default: 5)}

\item{verbose}{If true, prints information about initialisation progress (default: TRUE)}
}
\description{
A container for holding a set of narrowed alignments,
each corresponding to the same target region.  Individual samples are
represented as CrisprRun objects.  CrisprRun objects with no on-target
reads are excluded.

\describe{
\item{\code{crispr_runs}}{A list of CrisprRun objects, typically corresponding to samples
of an experiment.}

\item{\code{ref}}{The reference sequence for the target region, as a DNAString object}

\item{\code{cigar_freqs}}{A matrix of counts for each variant}

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
\item{\code{classifyVariantsByLoc(txdb, add_chr = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)}}{Description:
  Uses the VariantAnnotation package to look up the location of the 
  variants.  VariantAnnotation allows multiple classification tags per variant,
  this function returns a single tag.  The following preference order is used:  
  spliceSite > coding > intron > fiveUTR > threeUTR > promoter > intergenic

Input parameters:
  txdb:     A BSgenome transcription database
  add_chr:  Add "chr" to chromosome names to make compatible with UCSC (default: TRUE)
  verbose:  Print progress (default: TRUE)
  
Return value:
  A vector of classification tags, matching the rownames of .self$cigar_freqs 
  (the variant count table)
  }

\item{\code{filterUniqueLowQual(min_count = 2, max_n = 0, verbose = TRUE)}}{Description:
  Deletes reads containing rare variant combinations and more than 
  a minimum number of ambiguity characters within the target region.
  These are assumed to be alignment errors.

Input parameters:
  min_count:    the number of times a variant combination must occur across 
                all samples to keep (default: 2, i.e. a variant must occur
                at least twice in one or more samples to keep)
  max_n:        maximum number of ambiguity ("N") bases a read with a rare
                variant combination may contain.  (default: 0)
  verbose:      If TRUE, print the number of sequences removed (default: TRUE)}

\item{\code{mutationEfficiency(snv = c("include", "exclude", "non_variant"),
  include.chimeras = TRUE, exclude_cols = NULL)}}{Description:
  Calculates summary statistics for the mutation efficiency, i.e.
  the percentage of reads that contain a variant.  Reads that do not 
  contain and insertion or deletion, but do contain a single nucleotide 
  variant (snv) can be considered as mutated, non-mutated, or not 
  included in efficiency calculations as they are ambiguous.

Input parameters:
  snv:    One of "include" (consider reads with mismatches to be mutated),
          "exclude" (do not include reads with snvs in efficiency calculations),
          and "non_variant" (consider reads with mismatches to be non-mutated).
  include.chimeras: Should chimeras be counted as variants?  (Default: TRUE)
  exclude_cols:   A list of column indices to exclude from calculation, e.g. if one
                  sample is a control (default: NULL, i.e. include all columns)
Return value:
  A vector of efficiency statistics per sample and overall}

\item{\code{plotVariants(freq.cutoff = 1, top.n = nrow(.self$cigar_freqs),
  renumbered = .self$pars["renumbered"], add.other = TRUE, ...)}}{Description:
  Wrapper for crispRvariants:plotAlignments, optionally filters the table 
  of variants, then plots variants with respect to the reference sequence, 
  collapsing insertions and displaying insertion sequences below the plot.

Input parameters:
  freq.cutoff:      i (integer) only plot variants that occur >= i times
                    (default: 0, i.e no frequency cutoff)
  top.n:            n (integer) Plot only the n most frequent variants 
                    (default: plot all)
                    Note that if there are ties in variant ranks, 
                    top.n only includes ties with all members ranking <= top.n    
  renumbered:       If TRUE, the x-axis is numbered with respect to the target 
                    (cut) site.  If FALSE, x-axis shows genomic locations.
                    (default: TRUE)
  add.other         Add a blank row named "Other" for chimeric alignments,
                    if there are any (Default: TRUE)
  ...               additional arguments for plotAlignments

Return value:
  A ggplot2 plot object.  Call "print(obj)" to display  }
